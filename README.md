```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

## TODO
1. Make the app standalone without the need for FFmpeg installation (potentially using the Flutter FFmpeg package).
2. Fix the window resizing issue.
3. Add support for more video file types for conversion.
4. Extend the app to be compatible with multiple operating systems.

Feel free to contribute by addressing these TODO items or by submitting new features and enhancements. Your contributions are highly appreciated!
